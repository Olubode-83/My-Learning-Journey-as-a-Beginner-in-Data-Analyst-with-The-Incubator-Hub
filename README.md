# My-Learning-Journey-as-a-Beginner-in-Data-Analyst-with-The-Incubator-Hub
This is just the kick-off point for my portfolio building during my learning with the Digital SkillUp Africa.
As a starter, I’ve learnt a lot from the class.
In fact, the class was so much engaging, fun and fascinating, that you can’t afford to miss any session.
During the training, I've learnt how to use MS Excel, SQL, GitHub for Portfolio building and Powe BI.- still very much open for learning.
